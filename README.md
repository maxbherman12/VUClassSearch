# VUClassSearch

VUClassSearch is a web platform built to help connect Vanderbilt University students with their classmates. Our mission is to forge relationships between peers to increase the exposure of information pertinent to students' success.

VUClassSearch is build using the MERN stack. It uses Google OAuth 2.0 with JSON webtokens for user authentication and securely storing user data. These actions are facilitated by the Passport package.

Axios is used for all API requests and facilitates data exchange for the application. Our contact form is run through EmailJS.

To help with the UI, many MaterialUI components and icons were used as well as the react-image-gallery package.

This site is hosted on heroku and can be visited at https://vuclasssearch.herokuapp.com/

To get started, you must sign in with a valid Vanderbilt email address. Begin by adding a course to your schedule. You may then navigate to the course page where you will be able to see a list of students also enrolled in that section of the course. Furthermore, you can create or join a GroupMe for the course so that you can more easily communicate with your peers.
